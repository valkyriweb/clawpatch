description: "clawpatch is an automated code review tool that maps repos into semantic feature slices, reviews each with AI providers, persists findings, and can land fixes."
---

## Try it

After installation and project initialization ([Quickstart](quickstart.md)), everything is a single command:

```bash
# Map repo into reviewable features
clawpatch map

# Review features in parallel
clawpatch review --limit 3 --jobs 3

# Generate findings report
clawpatch report

# Fix a specific finding
clawpatch fix --finding <id>

# Re-validate after manual edits
clawpatch revalidate --finding <id>
```

`--json` produces stable JSON on stdout. Human progress and warnings go to
stderr so pipes stay parseable.

## What clawpatch does

- **Semantic feature mapping.** Detects npm bins, Next.js routes, Python packages and Flask routes, Go packages, Rust crates, SwiftPM targets, and common config files as reviewable slices.
- **Automated code review.** Reviews features with AI providers (Codex CLI today), persists findings with severity, category, and line locations.
- **Explicit fix workflow.** `clawpatch fix` runs validated patches for one finding at a time, never commits or pushes automatically.
- **Stable state model.** All features, findings, patches live in `.clawpatch/` as JSON, resumable across runs.
- **Safety first.** Review is read-only, fix refuses dirty worktrees, never auto-commits, validates before accepting patches.
- **Multi-language.** JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Swift today; more mappers planned.

## Pick your path

- **Trying it.** [Install](install.md) → [Quickstart](quickstart.md). Five minutes from `pnpm add` to your first review.
- **Understanding features.** [Feature Mapping](feature-mapping.md) explains how clawpatch slices repos into reviewable units.
- **Running reviews.** [Code Review](code-review.md) covers provider integration, parallel execution, and finding categories.
- **Fixing findings.** [Patching](patching.md) documents the explicit fix workflow and validation steps.
- **Reading reports.** [Reporting](reporting.md) shows how to generate Markdown reports and filter by severity.
- **Configuring providers.** [Providers](providers.md) lists supported backends and future provider integration plans.
